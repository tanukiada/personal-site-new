      <h2> Hobbies / Interests</h2>
      <p>
	My primary hobby / interest is computing. I love learning about computers, their history, and how they work. I usually work with modern distributions of computing software, but my partner has inspired me to explore more retro platforms and software.
      </p>
      <p>
	My other biggest hobby is ham radio, where I hold my US General class license. I am hoping to gain my extra class soon and have already began studying for it.
      </p>
      <p>
	Other than that I tend to juggle many hobbies throughout life, but I am hoping to take a more active set as an alternative to sitting inside all day working with computers and radios.
